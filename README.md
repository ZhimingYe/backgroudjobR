## Overview

`backgroudjobR` is an R package that provides robust and flexible solutions for executing R scripts with comprehensive error handling, logging, and background processing capabilities. Whether you need to run scripts locally, in the background, or on remote servers, this package offers the tools to do so safely and efficiently. This package is powered by the powerful `mirai` package, for providing the background execution and automatic load balancing framework.

### Key Features

-   **üîí Safe Execution**: Run R scripts in isolated environments with comprehensive error handling
-   **üìù Comprehensive Logging**: Automatic logging of execution progress, errors, and memory usage (Please refer to `package website`'s `Article` -\> `Log Example` for details)
-   **üíæ Auto-Recovery**: Automatic environment saving when errors occur for debugging
-   **üöÄ Background Processing**: Execute jobs in background using the powerful `mirai` framework
-   **üñ•Ô∏è Server-Friendly**: Create standalone projects for execution with `screen`, `tmux`, or `nohup`
-   **üìä Memory Monitoring**: Built-in memory usage tracking and limits
-   **‚ö° Parallel Execution**: Support for multiple background jobs with automatic load balancing (by `mirai`)

## Aim

Do you miss RStudio's background jobs feature in terminal, VSCode or in the new developed IDE Positron? Though Positron have a multiple-console feature, but it is unstable in many cases (See their github issues).

So `backgroudjobR` is developed for solve this problem.
